# Switch

Switches for toggling a value between two states

```tsx
import { Switch } from "@formatomus/headlessui";

<Switch />;
```

The `<Switch />` component includes all the props and namespaces the regular [HeadlessUI `<Switch />`](https://headlessui.com/react/switch) component has, while automatically registering the component to the `useForm` hook context.

Ensure the component is wrapped in the [`<FormElement />`](/form-elements/headlessui#use-within-formatomus) component so that is it registered to your useForm hook context correctly.

:::tip
The HeadlessUI Switch component will always register as a **controlled input**
:::

## Styling

Please refer to the HeadlessUI docs for their [Switch component](https://headlessui.com/react/switch), you can still achieve everything demonstrated there.

We just simply wrap it with the `useForm` register logic for you!

## [Error Handling](/form-elements/headlessui#error-handling)

## Namespace crossover?

You may notice that HeadlessUI exports a [`<Switch.Label />`](https://headlessui.com/react/switch#using-a-custom-label) component for adding an accessible label to the switch.

While Formatomus also exports [`<FormElement.Label />`](/form-elements#element-label) for the same functionality, it is up to you which one you would like to use here (they both perform in the same way).

For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="formatomus" label="Formatomus' Label" default>

```tsx
import { FormElement } from "@formatomus/core";
import { Switch } from "@formatomus/headlessui";

<FormElement name="switch">
  // highlight-next-line
  <FormElement.Label>Switch</FormElement.Label>
  <Switch />
</FormElement>;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="headlessui" label="HeadlessUI's Label">

```tsx
import { FormElement } from "@formatomus/core";
import { Switch } from "@formatomus/headlessui";

<FormElement name="switch">
  // highlight-start
  <Switch.Group>
    <Switch.Label>Switch</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.Description>I've looked at the word Switch too much and now it looks funny</Switch.Description>
    // highlight-end
    <Switch />
    // highlight-next-line
  </Switch.Group>
</FormElement>;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Component API

Please refer to the HeadlessUI docs for their [Switch component](https://headlessui.com/react/switch#component-api)

:::caution
However you can't use the props `id`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `checked`, `ref`, `value`, `name`, `defaultChecked` as these are handled by React Form Hook
